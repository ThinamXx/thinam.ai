I am a second year Computer Science and Information Technology student at TU. My research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I am passionate about building intelligent systems with the help of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

I am working as a Research Assistant at [**Center of Data Mining and Bioinformatics**](https://mt.mahidol.ac.th/en/departments/center-of-data-mining-and-biomedical-informatics-2/). I have also worked as an NLP Engineer at Kharpann Enterprises. My primary tools are Python, PyTorch and Fastai. I'm learning from online materials and reading books of Machine Learning.
